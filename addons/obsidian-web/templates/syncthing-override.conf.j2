# Syncthing systemd dropin — security hardening
# Deployed by Ansible (obsidian-web addon) to:
#   /etc/systemd/system/syncthing@.service.d/obsidian.conf
#
# UMask=0077 ensures vault files and directories created by Syncthing are
# accessible only to the owner (mode 600 for files, 700 for directories).
# Without this, Syncthing defaults to UMask=0022, leaving files world-readable.
